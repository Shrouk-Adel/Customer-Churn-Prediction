# Customer-Churn-Prediction
- A telecommunications company is concerned about the number
   of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
  They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst
  at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.
  


 We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn.
   This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer.
   The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can
   use immediately. 

## About the data: (As provided in the overview/description)

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
