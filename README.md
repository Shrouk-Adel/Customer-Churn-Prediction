# Customer-Churn-Prediction
- A telecommunications company is concerned about the number
   of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
  They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst
  at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.
  
## Business Understanding
-- Churn Prediction : 
identifying customers who are likely to cancel their contracts soon.

1. If the company can do that, it can handle users before churn
2. The target variable that we want to predict is categorical and has only two possible outcomes: churn or not churn (Binary Classification).
3. We also would like to understand why the model thinks our customers churn, and for that, we need to be able to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions.

- We will use data from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

According to the description, this dataset has the following information:

- Services of the customers: phone; multiple lines; internet; tech support and extra services such as online security, backup, device protection, and TV streaming
- Account information: how long they have been clients, type of contract, type of payment method
- Charges: how much the client was charged in the past month and in total
- Demographic information: gender, age, and whether they have dependents or a partner
- Churn: yes/no, whether the customer left the company within the past month
