# Customer-Churn-Prediction
- A telecommunications company is concerned about the number
   of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.
  They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst
  at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.
  
## About the dataset

 We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn.
   This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer.
   The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can
   use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones,
   so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.

   This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain
   customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
